            <p>on 26 mar 2024, at 1:28 am, a cargo ship from the port of baltimore en route to sri lanka lost control and unfortunately rammed into the 1.6 mile long francis scott key bridge, a vital bridge both for commuters as well as the transport of hazmats. six people are proclaimed dead as of midnight mar 27, the time i'm writing this.
            <p>my heart goes out to the people affected. the families that are heartbroken. the rescue workers trying to find them. those on the ship that couldn't regain control. please send prayers. </p>
            <p>the bridge was opened in '77. it celebrated its anniversary just three days before the collapse. </p>

            <p>this is a personal image driving over the bridge taken 24 nov 2022, heading to a party. i have some fond memories riding over this bridge to make it to a few of my friends' houses. guess we're going to need a new route.
