            <h2>&#x25b8; quick political ramblings... etcetera</h2>
            <p>
                First off, let me just say WHAT an election night that was. Wow. That... 
                that was honestly insane. Surprising? Not really. But... insane? <i>Yes.</i>
            </p>
            <p>This article isn't really about my political standpoint, and I usually don't even go as far as I'm about to go regarding politics, but I do think that Trump 
                probably wasn't the... best... choice, just given his <i>objective</i> record. But neither was the underprepared Kamala who
                had to basically sub-in for Biden in just a handful of months before the election, and coming
                off the reels of unimpressive performance from Biden... well.. a [redacted]show is the result.
            </p>
            <p>Rather, this article is about the curiosities of this election season I picked up on. 
                This is really the first election that I was able to actually pay attention to, and I've learned a lot
                since 2020's election.
            </p>
            <p>Trump really took the advantage this election. Somehow, he resonated in all interurban, multiracial, 
                working class to higher up Americans. Surprisingly, the Latino vote was a huge factor in this one,
                where he unexpectedly took a notiable margin in that sector EVEN WITH multiple targeted deportation
                efforts within his agenda.
            </p>
            <p>Kamala on the other hand is losing her grip on suburban voters, ESPECIALLY within key states. PA, WI, MI, 
                to name a few. And I think part of that is that Trump <i>resonated</i> with that demographic of people:
                the standard parent-children single family household.
            </p>

            <p>As I watched this election take place deep into the night, I was looking at the numbers as the advantage by the blue team waned and basically
                SCREAMING in my head at election callers that PA had basically locked out Democrats from taking the all-important 19 points.
                The suburban sector around Phila. and Pitts. as well as Erie County had flipped red. Same in WI where 
                Milk-walk-ee and extreme northern Chicago subs and Kenosha had flipped. These were really important for Dems 
                to take if they wanted to win and I don't think enough persuasion was applied to these sectors by them.
            </p>
            <p>This season ain't over yet, and it is clear that "Red Winter is Coming." Both sides must not lose their focus
                especially if they want to hit 2028 much stronger. Accusations of cheating (from what I've seen, especially by the left, surprisingly, at this point), though not debunked, is just going to perpetuate a sense
                of unacceptance and saltiness that qute frankly isn't needed? I get the notion of "not going out without a fight"
                but one needs to realize that losing is part of the game as well. Time will tell...
            </p>
            <p>With that though, one needs to ask what would have happened if Trump <i>didn't win...</i> Think about that. And think about 1/6 as well...</p>
            <p>Perhaps we should elect Hatsune Miku next.</p>
