            <h2>&#x25b8; the spanish rail network, and a lesson on navigation</h2>
            <p>
                I've never told this narrative to many... so let me tell you a tale about trains, timetables, and navigating a network 
                not really meant for us. Oh, and churros.
                Back in the spring of '23 I was priviledged enough to travel to the
                country with arguably the second-most best high speed rail network: Spain. 
                And, oh boy, that was one heck of a whirlwind. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately after school the day spring break had begun, we had went
                directly to IAD for our flight to BCN via BRU. While that leg of the trip 
                was unspectacular at best, I had landed in Barcelona 26 hours without sleep
                and still had another 4 hours until I could reach the sweet relief of a matress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here came our first test of interpreting maps. We had needed to go from the airport station
                to <i>Sant Vicenç de Calders</i>, which is only served by the <b>R2 Sud</b> and <b>R4</b> (though numerous regional express lines cover it). For some reason, 
                the <b>R2</b> is split into three variants (but for some reason there are more which I'll get
                to in a second). We had to coordinate a weird double-back manuver as the airport is only served by
                <b>R2 Nord</b> as a stub station. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We transferred to the reverse direction at the station immediately following <i>Aeroport</i> on the
                main line. And we were on our way to the destination... unless...
            </p>
            <h3>LESSON 1 | PAY ATTENTION TO THE DESTINATION</h3>
            <p>
                I increasingly became much more worried once I realized that this train
                ain't goin' all the way to the end. Yeah... not all <b>R2 Sud</b> trains 
                are created equally, and I failed to see this immediately. YOU CAN'T BLAME 
                ME THOUGH I WAS SLEEP DEPRIVED and EVERYTHING was in CATALAN! We ended up stopping short 
                of <i>Sant Vicenç de Calders</i> and was stuck for a good half-hour at <i>Vilanova i la Geltrú</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember when I said the <b>R2</b> had three variants? Well, actually, there are
                12. None of which are clearly communicated on maps except for the 3 main ones.
                And the <b>R2 Sud</b> trains that go to <i>Sant Vicenç de Calders</i> does NOT stop at the 
                station we caught the line at, <i>El Prat de Llobregat</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the commuter rail system map needs to reflect this more, because unless one actually
                goes and reads timetables (which, be honest, who does?), but i digress...
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, if I actually took the time to read the headboard of the train, though, I should have
                known that this train would not have taken me all the way. Destinations of trains... anywhere, really... are 
                often clearly marked on displays so it would have been hard to miss if I were not so 
                ignorant. Fortunately it wasn't a "last train of the day"-type situation so we were able
                to wait for the next one, and all was well. 
            </p>
