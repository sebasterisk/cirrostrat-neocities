            <h2>&#x25b8; a tribute to the spanish churro stand</h2>
            <p>the spanish churro stand is legendary. in the most bleak and miserable situations, the churro stand will always be there. the taste of each bite is heavenly. it fulfills and nourishes in an indescribable way. its warm chocolate comes like a blanket on a winter's night, comfortable and snug, it feels like it came from the streams of heaven, you never want to stop indulging.
            </p>
            <p>imagine coming home from work. you hop outside the station, hungry and tired. right outside the station, just in the near distance, the churro stand, right there, like it always was. you order a dozen yet you know you can't finish it, but you can't stop enjoying the divine taste of the churro. </p>
            <p>millions envy the churro stand. but here, we embrace it. here, in this virutal environment, there is no way that we can feast on these wonderous churros. but with the power of images, we can be there, not physically, but spiritually. </p>
            <p>and remember, the churro does not lend itself only to the elite. it is available to all.</p>
