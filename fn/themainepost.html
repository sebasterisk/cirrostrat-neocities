    <h3>footnotes for this post</h3>
    thank <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samrugas/" class="nolinkstyle">@samrugas</a> for images I to III<br>
    <br>the first image was taken along the cadillac mountain road frontage in acadia nat'l park, posturized to 25 colors<br>

    <br>there is some lore as to <i>why</i> old orchard beach no longer has an old orchard but that is beyond the scope of this post so i reccomend looking it up if you're curious<br>
    <br>i had two lobsters that night, they were quite tasty<br>
