            <h2>&#x25b8; about me</h2>
            i am a man of simple interests,<br>
            &emsp; of simple ideals,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp; of simple desires.<br>
            <br>
            take some notes. <br>
            <br> 
            i am a so-called "weather enthusiast" and the founder of a
            meteorology club in middle school. from a certain standpoint,
            one could possibly say that "i peaked in middle school" because of this but
            i wouldn't say that myself.
            <br><br>
            i also dabble in linux and cybersecurity, and i'd say i'm pretty good at it. i mean,
            not many people would know what the "touch" command would do when asked so i already
            have a leg up over 90% of the population. presumably
            <br><br>
            i also do robotics.
