                i am a man of simple interests,<br>
                &emsp; of simple ideals,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp; of simple desires.<br>
                <br>
                take some notes. <br>
                <br> 
                i am a so-called "weather enthusiast" and the founder of a
                meteorology club in middle school. from a certain standpoint,
                one could possibly say that "i peaked in middle school" because of this but
                i wouldn't say that myself.
                <br><br>
                i also dabble in linux and cybersecurity, and i'd say i'm pretty good at it. i mean,
                not many people would know what the "touch" command would do when asked so i already
                have a leg up over 90% of the population. presumably
                <br><br>
                i also do robotics. 7135E for the win! we will go to worlds! someday, at least...
